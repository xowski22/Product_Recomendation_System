1.1 Collaborative Filtering Approach
-

Our implementation uses model-based collaborative filtering through matrix factorization. The core idea is to decompose user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional latent feature speces.

Given a sparse user-item matrix R, we decompose it into:

- User matrix U ∈ ℝ^(m×k)
- Item matrix v ∈ ℝ^(m×k)

Where:

- m is the number of users
- n is the number of items
- k is the embedding dimension

The rating prediction is then computed as:

r̂ᵤᵢ = μ + bᵤ + bᵢ + uᵤᵀvᵢ

Where:

- μ is the global bias
- bᵤ is user bias
- bᵢ is item bias
- uᵤᵀvᵢ is the dot product of user and item latent features

1.2 Neural Network implementation
-

I chose to implement matrix factorization using neural networks for a few reasons:

- Better handling of non-linear relationships
- Flexibility in architecture modifications
- Modern optimization techniques
- Easy integration of regularization methods

2.System Architecture Deep Dive
-

2.1 Data processing pipeline
-

Our data pipeline is designed for efficient processing of the MovieLens-1M dataset while maintaining flexibility in other datasets.

Design Considerations

1. Abstraction Layer

```angular2html
class BaseDataLoader(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def load_data(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def proprocess_data(self):
        pass
```

This abstract base allows for easy extension to other datasets while enforcing consistent interface

2. Factory Pattern for Data Loading
```angular2html
class DataLoaderFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def get_loader(config):
        if config['data']['type'] == 'movielens':
            return MovieLensLoader(config)
        # Extensible to other datasets
```

3. Preprocessing Pipeline

- ID Mapping: Converts string IDs to dense integers
- Rating Normalization: Scales ratings to [0,1] range
- Train/Val Split: Implements time-based splitting

2.2 Model Architecture decisions
-

Our Matrix Factorization model incorporates several key architectural decisions:

1. Embedding Layer Design

```angular2html
self.user_embeddings = nn.Embedding(num_users, embedding_dim)
self.item_embeddings = nn.Embedding(num_items, embedding_dim)
```

- Why Embeddings?
  - Efficient representation of sparse categorical data
  - Learnable dense representations
  - Memory efficient compared to one-hot encoding

2. Regularization Strategy

```angular2html
self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.2)

self.user_bn = nn.BatchNorm1d(embedding_dim)
self.item_bn = nn.BatchNorm1d(embedding_dim)
```

- Dropout prevents co-adaptation of features
- Batch Normalization:
  - Reduces internal covariate shift
  - Enables higher learning rates
  - Provides regularization effect

3. Bias Terms

```angular2html
self.global_bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))
self.user_bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(num_users))
self.item_bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(n_items))
```

- Captures user and items specific rating tendencies
- Global bias for dataset-wide rating trends
- Initialized to zero to learn true biases

3.Training Pipeline Implementation
-

3.1 Training Flow Architecture
-

The training pipeline is designed with following considerations:

1. Separation of Concerns
```angular2html
def train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, config):
    # Training orchestration

def train_epoch(model, train_loader, optimizer, criterion, device):
    # Single epoch training logic

def validate(model, val_loader, criterion, device):
    # Validation logic
```

2. Loss Function Calculation

The loss calculation in the training pipeline combines MSELoss with L2 regularization:
```angular2html
mse_loss = criterion(predictions, target)

reg_loss = model.reg_lambda * (torch.norm(user_embeds)**2 + torch.norm(item_embeds)**2)

loss = mse_loss + reg_loss
```

- MSE Loss measures prediction accuracy against actual ratings
- L2 Regularization prevents overfitting by penalizing large embedding values
- Combined loss balances between prediction accuracy and model complexity

3.2 Learning Rate Schedule
-

We implement learning rate scheduler with the following characteristics:

```angular2html
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer,
                                                        mode = 'min',
                                                        patience=3,
                                                        factor=0.2,
                                                        min_lr=1e-6)
```

- Reduces learning rate on plateau
- Prevents oscillation around local minima
- Enables faster initial learning

4.API Design Patterns
-

4.1 FastAPI Implementation
-

Request Validation
```angular2html
class RatingRequest(BaseModel):
    user_id: str = Field(..., description="User ID")
    item_id: str = Field(..., description="Item ID")
```

- Pydantic models for request validation
- Clear error messages for invalid inputs
- Automatic API documentation

Error Handling Strategy

```angular2html
@app.post("/predict/rating/")
async def predict_rating(request: RatingRequest):
    try:
        user_id = int(request.user_id)
        item_id = int(request.item_id)
    except ValueError:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400,
            detail="IDs must be valid integers"
        )
```

- Graceful error handling
- Meaningful error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes

5.Performance Optimization
-

5.1 Batch Processing
-

```angular2html
    for batch in train_loader:
        user_ids = batch['user_id'].to(device, non_blocking=True)
        item_ids = batch['item_id'].to(device, non_blocking=True)
        ratings = batch['rating'].to(device, non_blocking=True)

        predictions, user_embeds, item_embeds = model(user_ids, item_ids)
```

- Efficient data movement to GPU
- Vectorized operations through PyTorch's DataLoader
- Memory-efficient processing of large datasets
- Built-in shuffling and parallel data loading

5.2 Model Optimization
-

The model architecture is optimized through several techniques:
```angular2html
class MatrixFactorization(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, users_ids, items_ids):
        user_embeds = self.dropout(self.user_embeddings(users_ids))
        item_embeds = self.dropout(self.item_embeddings(items_ids))

        user_embeds = self.user_bn(user_embeds)
        item_embeds = self.item_bn(item_embeds)
```

- Batch normalization for training stability
- Dropout for efficient regularization
- Direct tensor operations avoiding unnecessary computations
- Efficient use of PyTorch's built-in operations

6.Testing Strategy

-

Tests are designed to verify:

- Model architecture

-

```angular2html

    @task(3)
    def test_single_rating_prediction(self):
        # Simulates real-world usage patterns
```

- Simulates production load
- Measures response times
