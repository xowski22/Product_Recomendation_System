Matrix Factorization Recommendation System

1. Theoretical Foundation

1.1 Collaborative Filtering Approach

Our implementation uses model-based collaborative filtering through matrix factorization. The core idea is to decompose user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional latent feature speces.

Given a sparse user-item matrix R, we decompose it into:

- User matrix U ∈ ℝ^(m×k)
- Item matrix v ∈ ℝ^(m×k)

Where:

- m is the number of users
- n is the number of items
- k is the embedding dimention

The rating prediction is then computed as:

r̂ᵤᵢ = μ + bᵤ + bᵢ + uᵤᵀvᵢ

Where:

- μ is the global bias
- bᵤ is user bias
- bᵢ is item bias
- uᵤᵀvᵢ is the dot product of user and item latent features

1.2 Neural Network implementation

I chose to implement matrix factorization using neural networks for a few reasons:

- Better handling of non-linear relationships
- Flexibility in architecture modifications
- Modern optimization techniques
- Easy integration of regularization methods

2. System Architecture Deep Dive

2.1 Data processing pipeline

Our data pipeline is designed for efficient processing of the MovieLens-1M dataset while maintaining flexibility in other datasets.

Design Considerations
1. Abstraction Layer

```angular2html
class BaseDataLoader(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def load_data(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def proprocess_data(self):
        pass
```

This abstract base allows for easy extension to other datasets while enforcing consistent interface

2. Factory Pattern for Data Loading
```angular2html
class DataLoaderFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def get_loader(config):
        if config['data']['type'] == 'movielens':
            return MovieLensLoader(config)
        # Extensible to other datasets
```

3. Preprocessing Pipeline

- ID Mapping: Converts string IDs to dense integers
- Rating Normalization: Scales ratings to [0,1] range
- Train/Val Split: Implements time-based splitting

2.2 Model Architecture decisions

Our Matrix Factorization model incorporates several key architectural decisions:

1. Embedding Layer Design

```angular2html
self.user_embeddings = nn.Embedding(num_users, embedding_dim)
self.item_embeddings = nn.Embedding(num_items, embedding_dim)
```

- Why Embeddings?
  - Efficient representation of sparse categorical data
  - Learnable dense representations
  - Memory efficient compared to one-hot encoding

2. Regularization Strategy

```angular2html
self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.2)

self.user_bn = nn.BatchNorm1d(embedding_dim)
self.item_bn = nn.BatchNorm1d(embedding_dim)
```

- Dropout prevents co-adaptation of features
- Batch Nomalization:
  - Reduces internal covariate shift
  - Enables higher learning rates
  - Provides regularization effect

3. Bias Terms

```angular2html
self.global_bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))
self.user_bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(num_users))
self.item_bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(n_items))
```

- Captures user and items specific rating tendencies
- Global bias for dataset-wide rating trends
- Initialized to zero to learn true biases

3. Training Pipeline Implementation

3.1 Training Flow Architecture

The training pipeline is designed with following considerations:

1. Separation of Concerns
```angular2html
def train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, config):
    # Training orchestration

def train_epoch(model, train_loader, optimizer, criterion, device):
    # Single epoch training logic

def validate(model, val_loader, criterion, device):
    # Validation logic
```

2. Loss Function Design

```angular2html
